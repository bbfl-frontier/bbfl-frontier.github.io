John McGinn, born December 11th, 1891, in Belfast, was a southpaw boxer famed for his sharp jab and unyielding toughness. After an accidental killing in a dockside bout, he fled Ireland and found refuge in the Frontier States. By 1912, McGinn owned Tartan Arms Dealer, a modest gunsmiths shop known for its fine craftsmanship and discreet clientele. Known for his quiet discipline and fierce loyalty, McGinn preferred fists to firearms but never shied from either. His code was simple, Keep your word, keep your aim. Few who crossed him ever forgot the lesson he delivered.
